Let's dive right in!

`screen` is a program that creates virtual terminals inside your terminal.
It's somewhat like having multiple browser tabs, but for your command line!

Starting screen is super simple:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ screen
```

That's it!
You're now inside a screen session.
It looks _exactly_ like a terminal, but there are new capabilities there, waiting to be discovered.

For this challenge, we've hooked things up so that just launching screen will get you the flag.
Easy!

**NOTE:**
When you're done with your command line, type `exit` or press `Ctrl-D` to leave the screen session.
Then screen will terminate and return you to your _original_ shell.
