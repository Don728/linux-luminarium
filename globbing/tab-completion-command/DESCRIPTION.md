Tab completion is for more than files!
You can also tab-complete commands.
This level has a command that starts with `pwncollege`, and it'll give you the flag.
Type `pwncollege` and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

----
**NOTE:**
You can auto-complete any command, but be careful: callous auto-completes without double-checking the result can wreak havoc in your shell if you accidentally run the wrong commands!
