You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying.
Luckily, the shell saves a _history_ of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge.
This challenge will inject the flag into your history.
Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it!
In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!
